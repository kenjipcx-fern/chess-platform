  loading: () => <ChessBoardSkeleton />,
  ssr: false
});
```

**Asset Optimization**:

- [ ] Performance targets met (<2s load time, 60fps animations)
- [ ] Accessibility compliance verified (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- [ ] Mobile optimization complete with PWA capabilities
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility achieved
- [ ] State management working reliably across all features
- [ ] Real-time features synchronized with backend
- [ ] UI/UX matches design system and user expectations
- [ ] Test coverage >90% for critical user journeys
