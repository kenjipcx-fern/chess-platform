class ApiClient {
  private baseURL = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL;
  private token: string | null = null;
  
  async request<T>(endpoint: string, options: RequestOptions): Promise<T> {
    // Token refresh logic
    // Error handling with retry
    // Request/response transformation
    // Loading state management
  }
}

// API service layers
├── authApi.ts          # Authentication endpoints
├── gameApi.ts          # Game management endpoints  
├── userApi.ts          # User profile endpoints
├── matchmakingApi.ts   # Queue and matchmaking
